Income flows into Personal Income, which is then split into Personal Current Taxes and Disposable Personal Income. DPI flows to consumption categories, personal saving, and other personal outlays. PCE categories combine goods and services into functional groupings. 'Other Goods & Services' is a residual capturing furnishings, communications, personal care, household supplies, and miscellaneous services."
